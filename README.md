Sudoku Solver
=============

**Sudoku Solver** is an example of yet another sudoku solver. In this
implementation, it's really messy (i wrote it in a big hurry) and 
largely undocumented. Neverthless, it can solve at least most of low 
and middle level sudoku. 

It doesn't implement any backtracking techniques, but also doesn't 
use any bruteforce. Uses only both statistical elimination and 
deduction methods. It will be solving the sudoku with more possible 
solutions or these where backtracking is necessary in a never ending 
cycle, so be carefull.

Maybe, I will reimplement it in some better form as a ruby gem in 
the future.

Enjoy!
